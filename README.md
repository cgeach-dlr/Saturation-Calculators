# Saturation-Calculators
Code for calculating the severity of saturation effects for atmospheric resonance lidars

The subfolders contain the python code for computing the degree of saturation for calcium 
and calcium plus resonance lidars, for sodium, iron, and helium resonance lidars, and for
potassium resonance lidars, respectively, as presented in the corresponding publications
(DOIs to be added when available). In each case, there is a file containing the 
library of functions needed for the saturation calculations and a file containing the code
necessary to reproduce the plots presented in the respective publications. The code 
libraries for each resonance lidar target are distinct, though there is significant overlap.
